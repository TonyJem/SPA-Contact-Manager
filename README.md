### Task description:
Create a __single page__ contact management application using HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Do not use any third-party libraries.

User should be able to perform these tasks:
* View all contacts
* Add new contacts
* Edit existing contact
* Delete existing contact

Contact should have the following fields:
* __First name__ (required, only letters allowed)
* __Last name__ (required, only letters allowed)
* __Date of birth__ (required, only date is allowed)
* __Phone number__ (required, only numbers allowed)
* __E-mail__ (required, format check)

The Phone number and E-mail address should be unique and can not be used for multiple contacts.

Tips:
* Use localStorage and JSON to store the data
* Use appropriate HTML input types to help with validation
* Do not spend too much time on styling - make it look clean and focus on good coding practices
* Check validations and corner cases with data (very long text in the input field, a large number of contacts)
